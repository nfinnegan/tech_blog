## Description üìÅ

This project required a front end and backend build out using the MVC architectural structure. I used Express.js API to connect to mySQL database (Model), used a combination of JavaScript & Bootstrap on the front end (View) and used express.Router for my Controllers. A new user can view blogs created by other users on the homepage. If you try to go to the dashboard you are prompted to either sign up or log in. Upon sign up, your password will be safely hashed in the database. If you navigate back to the dashboard, you will see any existing blog posts made by you already, or the option to make a new one.

## User Story üë©

## Challenges/Known Issue üî¥

For this application, I definitely ran into a number of challenges as it relates to routes. Having worked through those were are two known issues I couldn't resolve, but would be good to revisit for future development.

Incomplete/Unresolved:

- Commenting:
  When a user is on the homepage, they can click on the title of the blog post to share their thoughts. Once the button has been clicked to the post the comment, it is saved to the database. I intentionally left the user on the comments page so they can see their comment displayed/added to the blog post. However, I was having issue thinking through how to serve up the correct handlebars view. On button click, I create a new database entry of the user's comment, but I couldn't think through how to create an additional action where I can use JavaScript to fetch the comments from the DB to view.

## Resources üí°

For this application I definitely leaned heavily on the Learning Assistant team to give me an extra set of eyes and guidance through debugging some route issues
