## Description 📁

This backend build out uses an Express.js API to connect to a mySQL database using sequelize, so we can perform CRUD operations on all of our tables (Category, Product, and Tags). This project is the culmination of last week's sprint where we learned sequelize and the significance of Object Relational Mapping (ORM).

## Getting Started

Once you've cloned down the repo, make sure to follow the installation instructions below. Once the dependencies have been installed, create a .env file to store your personal credentials and establish a connection with your database. Then use the schema.sql file to create your database, type `cat db/schema.sql | mysql -u root -p` into your terminal, enter your password if one exists. Feel free to use the seeds.sql file as well to get yourself started with dummy data ( to do so run `npm run seed`), or import your own. Once done, type `nodemon server.js` or `npm watch` to start listening on your dedicated localhost port. You will have the ability to create, update, delete, and find all existing database entries for all tables. Any changes you make will be saved to your database for future reference.
